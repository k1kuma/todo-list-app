## Project Name: To Do List
Objective:
Build a To Do List-type web application or API that meets the challenge requirements
	
##### Challenge Requirements: 
Choose to either build an Front-end App OR Back-end API. Whatever you build must fulfil these requirements...

If you choose to build a Back-end API you must be able to deploy a console that demonstrates the output of what you have created.
If you choose to build a Front-end application, you must be able to demo it either on local or web-accessible url
The user should be able to create multiple items that they want to remember to do and must be able to add, edit, and remove tasks
Note that you may define a To Do List anyway you like (e.g. Wunderlist and Trello are both considered To Do Lists)
Each item must have:
Title
Description
Status (i.e. Pending, Done)
Due Date
Make it simple for the user to track the status of multiple items as well as remember when things are due
Must work on a desktop web browser

##### Bonus Features:
**Note:** Your application may have these features. Implement all, some, or none of them - it’s up to you. You’re also free to come up with your own features!
Create and assign categories to tasks
Search functionality 
A calendar view so the user can see when things are due
Attach files to tasks
User accounts so that multiple users can manage their own lists
Create sub-tasks within any task
Email or text reminders before a task is due
Filter and/or sort tasks based on status
Anything you think would be a cool feature to showcase your skills!

##### Technology:
Use any languages, frameworks, or libraries you like (jQuery, Bootstrap, Ember, Angular, React, Vue.js, Foundation, et al.)
Any plugins or libraries for date picking, calendars, visuals you’d like
Use any storage mechanisms or patterns you like

##### Helpful Tips
Feel free to use https://html5boilerplate.com (or similar) to get your Front-end project bootstrapped quickly!
We don’t expect you to create everything by-hand or from scratch, we encourage you to look for existing plugins and frameworks that will help you!

# Simple ToDo List App

Simple ToDo List App created using MERN Stack, featuring MongoDB Atlas. 
This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

To kick-off the back-end server, go to the backend directory and run:

### `nodemon server.js`

In the project directory, to kick off web application you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
